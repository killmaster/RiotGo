RiotGo is a Go wrapper for the Riot API.
It is highly based on [TrevorSStone's goriot](https://github.com/TrevorSStone/goriot/blob/master/champion.go) and some past projects of mine.

Not everything is implemented as I'll add more funcionality as I find need for it on [Flamingo](https://github.com/killmaster/flamingo).
